# Hayride Docs 

This repository contains the source files for the Hayride documentation, which is built using Docusaurus. The documentation covers various aspects of the Hayride platform, including installation, usage, and development.

## Local Development

To run the documentation locally, follow these steps:

```
npm run start 
``` 

## Build 

```
npm run build
```

This command will generate a static version of the documentation in the `build` directory. You can then deploy this directory to a web server or hosting service of your choice.


## Serve
```
npm run serve
```

This command will serve the static files generated in the `build` directory. You can access the documentation at `http://localhost:3000`.
