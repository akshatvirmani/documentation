# WebAssembly Component (WAC)

The WebAssembly Component (WAC) provides a way to compose and run WebAssembly components. 

WAC is a superset of the WIT language, which allows for more complex compositions and interactions between components.

The Hayride platform uses WAC to define how components are composed together and how they interact with each other.

More detail about WAC can be found in the [WAC Repository](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wac).
