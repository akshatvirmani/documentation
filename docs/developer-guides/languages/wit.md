The WIT (Wasm Interface Type) language is used to define Component Model interfaces and worlds. WIT isn't a general-purpose coding language and doesn't define behaviour; it defines only contracts between components. 

More details about WIT can be found in the [WIT specification](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html)
