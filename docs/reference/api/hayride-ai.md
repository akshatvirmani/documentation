## Hayride AI API

The **Hayride AI Server** provides a dedicated API for AI-based interactions. This server is enabled by activating the ai feature during initialization:

```
hayride init --features.ai.enabled
```

Once enabled, the server exposes HTTP endpoints that allow interaction with AI agents using structured message payloads.

:::warning
The **Hayride AI API** is currently in **alpha**. Breaking changes may occur in upcoming releases. Please consult release notes and this documentation when integrating with this API.
:::

### Configuration

To use the AI server, your Hayride configuration file must define the ai feature with both a binary and HTTP address.

Hayride installs with default values, which can be customized as needed:

```
features:
  ai:
    bin: "hayride:ai-server@0.0.1"
    http:
      address: "http://localhost:8082"
```

:::tip
For detailed configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](../../developer-guides/advanced/configuration.md) .
